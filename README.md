# Buzz Bazaar

Welcome to the Buzz Bazaar repository! Buzz Bazaar is a platform designed to help Georgia Tech students buy and sell products within their campus community. 

You can access the live app at: [buzzbazaar.app](https://buzzbazaar.app).

## Features
- **User-friendly interface:** Easily list products, browse listings, and contact sellers.
- **Campus-focused:** Exclusively for Georgia Tech students.
- **Secure transactions:** Safe buying and selling experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. 

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/buzz-bazaar.git
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
cd buzz-bazaar
npm install
```

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`
Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.  
The page will reload when you make changes.  
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
See the section about running tests for more information.

#### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.  
The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!

#### `npm run eject`
> **Note:** This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.  
Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project so you have full control over them.  
All the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them.  
At this point, you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you're ready for it.

## Deployment
For more information on deploying your React app, refer to [Create React App Deployment](https://reactjs.org/docs/deployment.html).
